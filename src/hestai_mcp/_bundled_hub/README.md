# System Governance Directory (.hestai-sys)

This directory contains **read-only system governance** delivered by the HestAI MCP server.

## ⚠️ DO NOT MODIFY

These files are automatically managed by the MCP server and will be replaced on each server restart. Any manual changes will be lost.

## For AI Agents

**You have access to these governance files!** Even though `.hestai-sys` is gitignored, you can read these files using the `Read` tool.

### Key Governance Files

```bash
# System-wide rules (READ THESE FIRST)
.hestai-sys/governance/rules/naming-standard.oct.md
.hestai-sys/governance/rules/visibility-rules.oct.md
.hestai-sys/governance/workflow/000-SYSTEM-HESTAI-NORTH-STAR.md

# Your agent constitution (if binding as a role)
.hestai-sys/agents/{your-role}.oct.md

# Reusable skills
.hestai-sys/library/skills/*/SKILL.md
```

### How to Access

Use the `Read` tool:
```
Read .hestai-sys/governance/rules/naming-standard.oct.md
```

Use `Glob` to discover:
```
Glob pattern: .hestai-sys/**/*.md
```
