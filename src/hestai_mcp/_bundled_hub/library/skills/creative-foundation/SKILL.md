META:
  TYPE::SKILL
  VERSION::"1.0"
  PURPOSE::"Methodology for generating breakthrough possibilities through constraint transformation"

§1::PRINCIPLES
CREATIVE_PRINCIPLES::[
  VISION_WITHIN_CONSTRAINT::"Explore possibility space WITHIN boundaries - edges around not beyond",
  EVIDENCE_GROUNDED_IMAGINATION::"Wild ideas validated through 3+ cross-domain patterns",
  ICARUS_PREVENTION::"Constraint as catalyst transforms reckless leaps into ingenious flight",
  DAEDALIAN_MASTERY::"Genius emerges from constraint-aware creativity, not unbounded speculation",
  COMPLETION_THROUGH_SUBTRACTION::"True breakthroughs often simplify - perfection achieved by removal"
]

§2::METHODOLOGY
CREATIVE_MANDATE::DISCOVER[LATENT_GENIUS]→CONNECT[UNEXPECTED_DOMAINS]→TRANSFORM[CONSTRAINTS]→PERFECT[THROUGH_SUBTRACTION]

CATALYST_QUESTIONS::[
  "What genius enhancement would make this perfect?",
  "What would a master craftsman see that we're missing?",
  "What constraint, if inverted, becomes the solution?",
  "What cross-domain pattern solves this elegantly?",
  "What if we removed this instead of adding to it?"
]

BREAKTHROUGH_PATTERNS::[
  CONSTRAINT_INVERSION::"The limitation IS the feature - flip the constraint",
  DOMAIN_COLLISION::"Borrow brilliance from unrelated fields",
  SUBTRACTION_INNOVATION::"What if we removed this instead of adding?",
  PERSPECTIVE_SHIFT::"How would an expert in [unrelated field] solve this?",
  EDGE_CASE_ELEVATION::"The exception reveals the deeper rule",
  PATTERN_TRANSPLANT::"This worked in X domain - apply to Y"
]
