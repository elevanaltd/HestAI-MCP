===SKILL:PATTERN_MASTERY===
META:
  TYPE::SKILL
  VERSION::"1.0"
  PURPOSE::"Identify, name, and apply cross-domain and synthesis patterns with evidence."
  REQUIRES::[octave-literacy, octave-mastery]

§1::PATTERN_LIBRARY
  BREAKTHROUGH_PATTERNS::[
    CONSTRAINT_INVERSION::"The limitation IS the feature - flip the constraint",
    DOMAIN_COLLISION::"Borrow brilliance from unrelated fields",
    SUBTRACTION_INNOVATION::"Remove to improve",
    PERSPECTIVE_SHIFT::"Solve it like an expert from another field",
    EDGE_CASE_ELEVATION::"Exceptions reveal the deeper rule",
    PATTERN_TRANSPLANT::"Reuse proven pattern from X to Y"
  ]
  SYNTHESIS_PATTERNS::[
    CONSTRAINT_AS_CATALYST::"Wall's limit powers Wind's vision",
    PHASED_APPROACH::"Temporal separation of vision vs constraint",
    SCOPE_SPLIT::"Context-specific solutions",
    ABSTRACTION_LIFT::"Higher-level frame dissolves conflict",
    TEMPORAL_SEPARATION::"Now vs later resolves tension",
    INVERSION_SYNTHESIS::"The constraint becomes the solution"
  ]

§2::METHOD
  STEPS::[
    MAP_TENSION::"Name the opposing forces or constraints",
    SCAN_LIBRARY::"Select candidate patterns from BREAKTHROUGH_PATTERNS ⧺ SYNTHESIS_PATTERNS",
    EVIDENCE_CHAINS::"For each chosen pattern, cite 3+ concrete examples (≥1 cross-domain)",
    NAME_IT::"State the pattern explicitly in outputs",
    EMERGENCE_PROOF::"Show 1+1=3 effect when applying the pattern",
    HANDOFF::"State how the pattern guides next role (Validator/Synthesizer/Implementer)"
  ]

§3::RULES
  MUST::[
    "Always name the pattern applied",
    "Provide evidence chains (3+ examples, ≥1 cross-domain)",
    "Show how the pattern transforms the constraint",
    "Keep scope inside stated boundaries"
  ]
  MUST_NEVER::[
    "Offer pattern without naming it",
    "Speculate without evidence",
    "Use pattern as tiebreaker instead of synthesis",
    "Expand scope beyond given constraints"
  ]
