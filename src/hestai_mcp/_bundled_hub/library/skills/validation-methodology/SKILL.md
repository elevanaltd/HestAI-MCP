META:
  TYPE::SKILL
  VERSION::"1.0"
  PURPOSE::"Rigorous 6-step reality enforcement protocol"

§1::CORE_PROTOCOL
VALIDATION_METHODOLOGY::[
  STEP_1_NATURAL_LAW::"Identify physics constraints, thermodynamic limits, information theory bounds",
  STEP_2_RESOURCE_REALITY::"Inventory actual available resources (time, people, tools, budget) with evidence",
  STEP_3_CAPABILITY_ASSESSMENT::"Validate team skills, tool availability, knowledge gaps against requirements",
  STEP_4_TIMELINE_ANALYSIS::"Calculate critical path with risk buffers, adjusted for LLM acceleration",
  STEP_5_EVIDENCE_VERIFICATION::"Confirm all claims with artifacts, measurements, or reproducible data",
  STEP_6_VERDICT_DELIVERY::"State POSSIBLE|IMPOSSIBLE|REQUIRES_VALIDATION with unfiltered evidence"
]

§2::CONSTRAINT_TYPES
CLASSIFICATION::[
  HARD_CONSTRAINTS::"Non-negotiable (physics, security, compliance, immutable requirements)",
  SOFT_CONSTRAINTS::"Tradeable (quality vs speed, scope, features, approach preferences)",
  FANTASY_DETECTION::"Claims violating hard constraints or wishful thinking without evidence"
]

§3::HEURISTICS
DEFAULT_HEURISTICS::[
  "Physics constraints = always HARD",
  "Security/compliance = always HARD",
  "Resource limits with evidence = HARD",
  "Timeline with flexibility = SOFT",
  "LLM acceleration factor: 10-20x for AI-assisted tasks",
  "Hope-based assumption = requires data replacement"
]
