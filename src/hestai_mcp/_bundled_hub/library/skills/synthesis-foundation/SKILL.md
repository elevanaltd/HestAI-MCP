===SKILL:SYNTHESIS_FOUNDATION===
META:
  TYPE::SKILL
  VERSION::"1.0"
  PURPOSE::"Methodology for third-way synthesis and tension transcendence"

§1::SYNTHESIS_METHODOLOGY
STEPS::[
  STEP_1_TENSION_MAP::"Identify explicit oppositions between Wind expansion and Wall constraint",
  STEP_2_KERNEL_FIND::"Locate where BOTH positions are correct - the shared truth",
  STEP_3_PATTERN_DISCOVER::"Find the organizing principle that unifies apparent contradiction",
  STEP_4_THIRD_WAY_FORGE::"Create emergent solution that honors both and exceeds either",
  STEP_5_EMERGENCE_PROVE::"Demonstrate 1+1=3 - what becomes possible that neither saw alone",
  STEP_6_PATH_CONCRETE::"Provide actionable implementation, not just theory"
]

§2::SYNTHESIS_PATTERNS
PATTERNS::[
  CONSTRAINT_AS_CATALYST::"Wall's limit becomes Wind's creative boundary - limitation enables",
  PHASED_APPROACH::"Wind's vision as target, Wall's concerns as gates - temporal integration",
  SCOPE_SPLIT::"Different solutions for different contexts - contextual integration",
  ABSTRACTION_LIFT::"Higher view dissolves apparent conflict - level transcendence",
  TEMPORAL_SEPARATION::"Now vs later resolves immediate tension - time as synthesis axis",
  INVERSION_SYNTHESIS::"The constraint IS the solution - polarity flip"
]
