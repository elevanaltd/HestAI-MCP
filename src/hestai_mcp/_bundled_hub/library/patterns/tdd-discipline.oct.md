META:
  TYPE::PATTERN
  VERSION::"1.0"
  PURPOSE::"Red-Green-Refactor discipline enforcement for implementation"

§1::CORE_PROTOCOL
CYCLE::[
  RED::"Write test describing behavior -> MUST FAIL -> Verify fails for right reason",
  GREEN::"Write minimal code to pass test -> MUST PASS -> Resist feature creep",
  REFACTOR::"Identify complexity -> Refactor small steps -> Run tests -> Revert if fail"
]

§2::GIT_WORKFLOW
PATTERN::[
  "test: Add failing test for X" (RED),
  "feat: Implement X" (GREEN),
  "refactor: Simplify X" (REFACTOR)
]
VALIDATION::"Reviewer verifies commit order: implementation preceded by test"

§3::ANTI_PATTERNS
AVOID::[
  TEST_AFTER::"Writing tests after code fits tests to implementation, not requirements",
  SINGLE_COMMIT::"Squashing Red/Green states hides the discipline",
  MOCKING_EVERYTHING::"Tests pass but integration fails - balance unit/integration",
  TESTING_INTERNALS::"Tests break on safe refactoring - test public API only"
