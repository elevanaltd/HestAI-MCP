That's the agent's submission. ARM = context (MCP injected). TENSION = interpretation (agent generated).",

      "wisdom": "When ceremony sequences grow, separate 'must happen in this command' from 'can happen elsewhere'. Vector Schema should be in constitution, not load sequence. Enforcement happens in validation, not as separate step.",

      "wisdom": "Binding ceremonies can be theater (agents fill forms) or kinetic (agents prove understanding). The difference is in what counts as 'proof'. TENSION as cognitive proof shifts from form-filling to interpretation.",
