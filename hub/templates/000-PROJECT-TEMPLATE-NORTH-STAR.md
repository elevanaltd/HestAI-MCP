# [PROJECT NAME] - NORTH STAR

**Project**: [Name of Project]

**Phase**: D1 (Understanding Establishment)
**Status**: 🟡 DRAFT (Awaiting Ceremony)
**Approved By**: [Name] on [Date]

## COMMITMENT STATEMENT

This North Star document establishes the immutable requirements for **[PROJECT NAME]**.

**Authority**: All work on this project (B0-B5 phases) must align with these requirements. Any detected misalignment triggers immediate escalation.

**Amendment Process**: Changes to immutables require formal review and re-approval. This is a binding commitment, not a living suggestion.

---

## PROTECTION CLAUSE

If ANY agent (or human) detects misalignment between work and this North Star:

1.  **STOP** current work immediately.
2.  **CITE** the specific North Star requirement being violated.
3.  **ESCALATE** to the project lead for resolution.

**Resolution Options**:
-   CONFORM work to North Star requirements.
-   AMEND North Star (requires formal process).
-   ABANDON incompatible implementation path.

## SECTION 2: THE UNCHANGEABLES (5-9 IMMUTABLES)

These requirements are **binding for the entire project**. Each must pass the **Immutability Oath**:
1.  *Is this truly immutable?*
2.  *Would we reject a faster/cheaper solution if it violated this?*
3.  *Will this still be true in 3 years?*

---

### I1: [IMMUTABLE NAME e.g., WORK TRACEABILITY]

**Requirement**: [Clear statement of the requirement].

**Technology-Neutral Expression**: [How this applies regardless of specific tools/stack].

**Evidence (Oath Passage)**:
-   **Q1 (Immutable?)**: YES — [User quote/reasoning]
-   **Q2 (Faster without?)**: NO — [Why speed doesn't justify violation]
-   **Q3 (True in 3 years?)**: YES — [Timeless quality]

**Rationale**: [Why this matters deeply].

**Validation Plan**:
-   ✅ [Testable criteria 1]
-   ✅ [Testable criteria 2]

### I2: [IMMUTABLE NAME]

**Requirement**: [Clear statement].

**Technology-Neutral Expression**: [Expression].

**Evidence**:
-   **Q1**: YES
-   **Q2**: NO
-   **Q3**: YES

**Rationale**: [Rationale].

**Validation Plan**:
-   ✅ [Criteria]

These assumptions underpin the North Star. **Critical/High impact assumptions must be validated.**

| ID | Assumption | Source | Risk if False | Validation Plan | Owner | Confidence | Impact |
|----|-----------|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------|-----------|--------|
| A1 | [Assumption Statement] | [Source] | [Risk] | [Plan] | [Name] | [0-100%] | [High/Med/Low] |
| A2 | [Assumption Statement] | [Source] | [Risk] | [Plan] | [Name] | [0-100%] | [High/Med/Low] |
| A3 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS (Must validate before B0)
-   **[ID]**: [Reason]
